# NACRe
Not A Cube Renderer, a little forward rendering engine / game engine :)

Several basic functionalities that you can expect from a game engine are implemented, including: 
* context creation
* shader management
* texture management
* vertex buffer management
* input handler
* basic scene system

It also has CMake support, and several libraries are included as submodules (see .gitmodules).
